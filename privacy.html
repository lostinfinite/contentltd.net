            <h1>ContentLTD Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p><strong>Date of Creation:</strong> 3/21/25</p>
            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 6/18/25</p><p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 6/18/25</p>
            <p>Welcome to ContentLTD. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you access or use our services, including Emergency Response: Liberty County (ER:LC) Roblox servers, associated Discord servers, and official websites (collectively, the "Services"). By using our Services, you agree to the terms described in this policy. If you do not agree, you must discontinue use of our Services.</p>
            <h2>Agreement and Acceptance</h2>
            <p>By using our Services, you affirm that you have read, understood, and agreed to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any portion of this policy, your only recourse is to discontinue use of our Services.</p>
            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <h3>1.1 Data Logged Automatically</h3>
            <p>We collect and log the following information when you interact with our Services:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Server details</li>
                <li>Guild IDs</li>
                <li>Invite links</li>
                <li>All messages sent, edited, or deleted within our Discord servers</li>
                <li>Information on who sent messages and where messages were sent</li>
                <li>All server names</li>
                <li>All channels regardless of visibility</li>
                <li>All roles</li>
                <li>All emojis</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This data is collected for moderation, security, and administrative purposes, as well as for the "Server Backup" function in our Content Solutions (SM) Bot, which allows server owners to restore their server in the event of a raid.</p>
            <h3>1.2 Additional Data That May Be Collected</h3>
            <p>In certain cases, we may also log additional details to prevent abuse and maintain security, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>IP addresses associated with user connections</li>
                <li>Device and browser type when accessing our website</li>
                <li>Timestamps of interactions with our services</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not actively track your location or other personally identifiable information (PII).</p>
            <h3>1.3 No Personal Data Requests</h3>
            <p>We do not provide data when or if requested, as it is impossible due to our storage and retention policies.</p>
            <h2>2. Your Privacy Choices</h2>
            <p>Your only method of opting out of our data collection is by leaving all servers we are affiliated with. A list of affiliated servers can be found on our official website under the "Our Servers" page.</p>
            <h3>2.1 Right to Anonymity</h3>
            <p>Users are encouraged to limit the personal information they voluntarily share in our Services. We are not responsible for any data users willingly disclose in chat, forums, or other public spaces within our Services.</p>
            <h3>2.2 No Guaranteed Data Deletion</h3>
            <p>Due to the way our logging systems function, we cannot guarantee the deletion of any logged information. Once recorded, messages and associated metadata remain stored indefinitely to ensure the safety, security, and integrity of our community.</p>
            <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the collected data to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enforce our Terms of Service</li>
                <li>Maintain the security and integrity of our Services</li>
                <li>Prevent fraud, abuse, and misconduct</li>
                <li>Enhance user experience and operational efficiency</li>
                <li>Investigate violations and enforce disciplinary actions</li>
                <li>Provide the "Server Backup" feature to server owners</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties outside of ContentLTD, except when required by law.</p>
            <h2>4. Data Retention and Security</h2>
            <p>We retain logged data for an indefinite period to ensure community safety and enforce our policies. Data is stored securely, and access is restricted to authorized personnel only. While we take reasonable steps to protect user data, no online system is completely secure, and users acknowledge the risks associated with online data transmission.</p>
            <h3>4.1 AI and Automated Features</h3>
            <p>We may use artificial intelligence (AI) for our Anti-Raiding features in our bot (possibly coming soon). AI-based detection will be used to enhance our security measures.</p>
            <h3>4.2 Data Breach Policy</h3>
            <p>In the unlikely event of a data breach, we will take immediate action to secure affected systems and may notify impacted users if required by applicable law.</p>
            <h2>5. International Data Protection Compliance</h2>
            <h3>5.1 U.S. Data Protection Standards</h3>
            <p>All privacy matters are governed by U.S. laws. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) does not apply to our Services. By using ContentLTD’s Services, you acknowledge and agree that your data is processed in accordance with U.S. laws and not GDPR.</p>
            <h3>5.2 Age Requirements</h3>
            <p>To use our Services, users must meet the age requirements outlined in our Terms of Service. Parents or guardians must provide consent for underage users where required by law. We do not knowingly collect data from users who fail to meet these age requirements.</p>
            <h2>6. Disclosure of Data</h2>
            <p>We may disclose collected data under the following circumstances:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> If required by law, court order, or government regulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Enforcement of Terms:</strong> To investigate violations and enforce disciplinary actions.</li>
                <li><strong>Protection of Rights and Safety:</strong> To protect the rights, safety, and security of ContentLTD, its users, or third parties.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not disclose data for commercial purposes or unauthorized third-party access.</p>
            <h2>7. Message Logging and Temporary Retention</h2>
            <p>To facilitate effective moderation and security within our Services, all messages transmitted via our Discord servers are logged through terminal outputs. Our service provider, Whispbyte (formerly Pylexnodes), maintains these terminal logs for a limited duration. The precise retention period is variable, dependent on the volume of messages, user actions, and moderation activities (including bans). Specifically, log wiping frequency is influenced by the rate of message generation, the number of administrative actions performed, and the size of our ban list. As a result, message logs are automatically and systematically purged within a timeframe ranging from minutes to a maximum of several hours.</p>
            <p>Due to this dynamic and short-term retention policy, we are unable to provide users with copies of their logged messages upon request. This practice is implemented to minimize data storage and enhance user privacy, while still providing the tools needed for effective moderation of our services.</p>
            <h2>8. Use of IP Address</h2>
<br>
<p>We temporarily use your IP address during your visit to:</p>
<p>• Check that you are not located in a restricted country, which currently includes: North Korea, Russia, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, and Israel.</p>
<p>• Ensure you are not banned from accessing our services.</p>
<p>• Detect possible VPN or proxy use, which may impact how the site behaves.</p>
<br>
<p>Your IP address is processed locally in your browser using a detection script. We do not store, log, or transmit this information. Even ContentLTD cannot see or access your IP address.</p>
<br>
<p>We use the <a href="https://ipapi.co" target="_blank">ipapi.co</a> service to retrieve country and ISP information. By using our services, your IP address is subject to <a href="https://ipapi.co/privacy/" target="_blank">ipapi.co’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<br>
<p>Use of VPNs or proxies is allowed, but may affect how our site loads or functions. You are free to continue using one at your own discretion.</p>

<h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on our website with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of our Services after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
            <h3>9.1 Notification of Changes</h3>
            <p>While we are not obligated to provide direct notifications of changes, we encourage users to periodically review this policy to stay informed.</p>
            <h2>10. Contact Information</h2>
            <p>If you have questions regarding this Privacy Policy, you may contact us at:</p>
            <p>Email: info@contentltd.net</p>
            <p><strong>Address:</strong> For legal inquiries, you may send correspondence to our designated office. Please note that we do not accept physical requests for data removal.</p>
